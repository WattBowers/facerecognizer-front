# Face-Recognizer


## Details

This project is built using React, along with the Clarifai api to detect faces in a photo. This is the front end of the app, you can find the code for the back end of the framework here: https://github.com/WattBowers/facerecognizer-api. This project was built with the help from the great mentors at Zero to Mastery on Udemy. 

### What I learned

Completing this project was one of the most difficult and rewarding experienceâ€™s I have overcome in recent memory. From learning how to implement API calls with asynchronous Javascript. To spending hours trying to debug errors with hosting services. Finishing this project from beginning to end has taught me an invaluable lesson in how to debug problems, be a self-sufficient coder, and how to come up with different and interesting ways to solve problems. There were numerous times when completing this project where I had that "Aha!" moment where the blocks aligned and I was able to make real, and meaningful progress towards fluency in programming. 

The other big thing that really became clear to me as I completed this project was how creative the process of programming is. As someone who comes from a performing arts background, it was quite refreshing to feel the sense of creative flow in creating a website that I would get from being a part of the creative industries. In watching, reading, and consuming content related to Javascript and React, it is so fascinating to see everyone's personal style in how they think about code. And how their brain works to find interesting solutions to their problems. 

### Getting this to run 

This code is connected to a backend server with Heroku. Feel free to clone the app and play around on your local machine, however thre will be some functionallity missing since the backend is required for much of the 'login' funcionality.
